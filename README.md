CLICK COUNTER
  
    It is a very basic website that counts the number of clicks on a div.
    It achieves it by using the onClick function and calling the function that increments the number of clicks on click.

    
    squares - stores the list of values having the class "colours"
    querySelectorAll method does it
    
    using for each function, we assign the function to all members of the squares list
    increment is done on the existing value displayed on the webpage
    
    reset function returns a html line of code that resets the count value of all squares members to 0.
